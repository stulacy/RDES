## Version update

I have added one small new feature, see NEWS.md for details.
I have also fixed the clang-USBSAN issue

## Test environments

* local Manjaro Linux, R 3.6.1
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

The note is: "Compilation used the following non-portable flag(s):
    ‘-march=x86-64’"
But I believe this to be a local issue and won't affect the install on other machines.
