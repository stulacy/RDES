Description: Provides functions for working with multi-state modelling, 
    such as efficient simulation routines for estimating transition probabilities and length of stay.
    It is designed as an extension to multi-state modelling capabilities provided with the 'flexsurv' 
    package (see Jackson (2016) <doi:10.18637/jss.v070.i08>).
